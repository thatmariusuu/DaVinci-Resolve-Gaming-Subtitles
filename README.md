This is your starting point. This tool is designed for editors working with interview or dialogue-heavy content across multiple audio tracks.

- **What it does**:
  - Analyzes multiple audio tracks and automatically creates a multi-camera style edit.
  - Use **Enhanced Interview Mode** to intelligently fill silent gaps for a seamless conversation.
  - Exports a new timeline file (`.otio`) that you can use in the next step.
  - Utilizes the included XML preset files for audio rendering from DaVinci Resolve.

### 2. The Ultimate Transcription Suite (`whisper subtitles in turns...`)

Once you have your `.otio` files, this is your all-in-one command center for transcription.

- **What it does**:
  - A beautiful GUI to manage your transcription projects.
  - **Listens to your `.otio` files** and generates highly accurate SRT subtitle files from the speech.
  - Use the **Professional Transcription Editor** to compare and perfect your transcripts.

### 3. The Subtitle Importer & Styler (`ResolveSubtitlePro.py`)

This is the final step, where you bring your subtitles into Resolve and give them a dynamic, professional look.

- **What it does**:
  - Imports your SRT files into DaVinci Resolve.
  - Applies complex logic to create an **entertaining, gaming-video style** presentation for your subtitles.
  - Uses your favorite **Text+ templates** for maximum customization.
  - Works seamlessly with the included snap captions templates.

### 4. DaVinci Resolve Files Collection üìÅ

The `Davinci Resolve Files` folder contains everything you need to get started immediately:

- **`Davinci Resolve Project.drp`**: A complete DaVinci Resolve project file containing professionally designed snap captions templates for subtitles. Simply open this project file in DaVinci Resolve to access the pre-built subtitle templates. **This is used by the Subtitle Importer & Styler script** to provide precise positioning and styling for your imported subtitles.

- **XML Audio Presets** (`AudioOnly1.xml` through `AudioOnly4.xml`): These are essential render preset files that enable the Automated Interview Editor script to export specific audio tracks from DaVinci Resolve for processing. Each preset corresponds to a specific audio track:
  - `AudioOnly1.xml`: Exports only Audio Track 1 from your timeline
  - `AudioOnly2.xml`: Exports only Audio Track 2 from your timeline
  - `AudioOnly3.xml`: Exports only Audio Track 3 from your timeline
  - `AudioOnly4.xml`: Exports only Audio Track 4 from your timeline

## Getting Started üõ†Ô∏è

Let's get you set up and ready to create!

- **FFmpeg**: This is a crucial open-source tool for handling video and audio files. The scripts rely on it to process media. It must be installed and accessible from your system's command line.

- **On Windows:**
  1. **Easy Installation (Recommended)**: Open Command Prompt or PowerShell as Administrator and run:
     ```cmd
     winget install FFmpeg
     ```
     This uses Windows' built-in package manager (available on Windows 10/11) and automatically handles PATH configuration.
  
  2. **Alternative Package Managers**: If you have [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) or [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) installed, you can also use:
     ```cmd
     choco install ffmpeg
     ```
     or
     ```powershell
     scoop install ffmpeg
     ```
  
  3. **Manual Installation (If above methods don't work)**: Download a pre-built version of FFmpeg from a trusted source like [gyan.dev](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/). The "essentials" build is usually sufficient.
  4. Extract the downloaded `.7z` file (you may need a tool like 7-Zip).
  5. Move the extracted folder to a permanent location (e.g., `C:\ffmpeg`).
  6. Add the `bin` directory inside that folder (e.g., `C:\ffmpeg\bin`) to your system's `PATH` environment variable. This allows you to run `ffmpeg` from any command prompt.
  7. To verify, open a new Command Prompt and type `ffmpeg -version`. You should see version information printed.

  - **On macOS:**
    The easiest way to install FFmpeg is with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). If you don't have Homebrew, install it first. Then, open your Terminal and run:
    ```bash
    brew install ffmpeg
    ```

  - **On Linux:**
    You can install FFmpeg using your distribution's package manager. Open your terminal and run the appropriate command:
    - **Debian/Ubuntu:**
      ```bash
      sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg
      ```
    - **Fedora/CentOS/RHEL:**
      ```bash
      sudo dnf install ffmpeg
      ```
    - **Arch Linux:**
      ```bash
      sudo pacman -S ffmpeg
      ```

### **Step 2: Continue with GPU Setup**

Then continue with the GPU acceleration setup below.

### GPU Acceleration with NVIDIA CUDA (Optional, but Recommended)

For a significant speed boost in transcription and audio processing, you can configure the scripts to use your NVIDIA GPU. This requires installing the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit and the correct version of PyTorch.

**Step 1: Install NVIDIA Drivers**

Ensure you have the latest NVIDIA drivers installed for your GPU. You can download them from the [official NVIDIA website](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx).

**Step 2: Install PyTorch with CUDA Support**

After installing the NVIDIA drivers, you need to install a version of PyTorch that is compiled for your specific CUDA version.

1.  Go to the [PyTorch installation page](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).
2.  Use the interactive tool to generate the correct installation command for your system. Here is an example of the selections:
    *   **PyTorch Build:** Stable (e.g., 2.7.1)
    *   **Your OS:** Windows/Mac/Linux
    *   **Package:** Pip
    *   **Language:** Python
    *   **Compute Platform:** Select the CUDA version you want to use (e.g., CUDA 12.8).
3.  The website will generate a command for you to run. It will look similar to this:

```bash
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
```

**Important:** Run the exact command generated by the PyTorch website. This will replace the version of PyTorch you installed earlier with one that can communicate with your GPU.

**NOTE:** This toolkit requires Python 3.12, which is fully compatible with the latest PyTorch versions.
