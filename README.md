     - Click on the Extensions icon in the left sidebar (or press `Ctrl+Shift+X` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd+Shift+X` on macOS)
     - Search for "Python" in the extensions marketplace
     - Install the official **Python extension by Microsoft** (it should be the first result with millions of downloads)
     - This extension provides syntax highlighting, IntelliSense code completion, debugging, code formatting, and integrated terminal support
  
  3. **Configure Python Interpreter**: Once the Python extension is installed:
     - Open any Python file (`.py`) or create a new one
     - VS Code will automatically detect your Python installation, or you can manually select it by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS) and typing "Python: Select Interpreter"
     - Choose the Python interpreter where you installed the required packages from the one-line installation command below
  
  With this setup, you'll have a professional development environment for editing and running the Python scripts in this toolkit!
- **FFmpeg**: This is a crucial open-source tool for handling video and audio files. The scripts rely on it to process media. It must be installed and accessible from your system's command line.

- **On Windows:**
  1. **Easy Installation (Recommended)**: Open Command Prompt or PowerShell as Administrator and run:
     ```cmd
     winget install FFmpeg
     ```
     This uses Windows' built-in package manager (available on Windows 10/11) and automatically handles PATH configuration.
  
  2. **Alternative Package Managers**: If you have [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) or [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) installed, you can also use:
     ```cmd
     choco install ffmpeg
     ```
     or
     ```powershell
     scoop install ffmpeg
     ```
  
  3. **Manual Installation (If above methods don't work)**: Download a pre-built version of FFmpeg from a trusted source like [gyan.dev](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/). The "essentials" build is usually sufficient.
  4. Extract the downloaded `.7z` file (you may need a tool like 7-Zip).
  5. Move the extracted folder to a permanent location (e.g., `C:\ffmpeg`).
  6. Add the `bin` directory inside that folder (e.g., `C:\ffmpeg\bin`) to your system's `PATH` environment variable. This allows you to run `ffmpeg` from any command prompt.
  7. To verify, open a new Command Prompt and type `ffmpeg -version`. You should see version information printed.

  - **On macOS:**
    The easiest way to install FFmpeg is with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). If you don't have Homebrew, install it first. Then, open your Terminal and run:
    ```bash
    brew install ffmpeg
    ```

  - **On Linux:**
    You can install FFmpeg using your distribution's package manager. Open your terminal and run the appropriate command:
    - **Debian/Ubuntu:**
      ```bash
      sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg
      ```
    - **Fedora/CentOS/RHEL:**
      ```bash
      sudo dnf install ffmpeg
      ```
    - **Arch Linux:**
      ```bash
      sudo pacman -S ffmpeg
      ```

### Installation Instructions

Choose the appropriate installation method based on your system:

**For systems WITHOUT NVIDIA GPU:**

Open your terminal or command prompt and run this command:

```bash
set TEMP=C:\tmp && set TMP=C:\tmp && pip install ctranslate2 faster-whisper nltk onnxruntime pandas transformers numpy librosa torch torchvision torchaudio tqdm matplotlib demucs python-vlc PyQt5 huggingface-hub opentimelineio && pip install pyannote-audio --no-deps
```

**For systems WITH NVIDIA GPU:**

First, run this command:

```bash
set TEMP=C:\tmp && set TMP=C:\tmp && pip install ctranslate2 faster-whisper nltk onnxruntime pandas transformers numpy librosa tqdm matplotlib demucs python-vlc PyQt5 huggingface-hub opentimelineio && pip install pyannote-audio --no-deps
```

Then continue with the GPU acceleration setup below.

### GPU Acceleration with NVIDIA CUDA (Optional, but Recommended)

For a significant speed boost in transcription and audio processing, you can configure the scripts to use your NVIDIA GPU. This requires installing the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit and the correct version of PyTorch.

**Step 1: Install NVIDIA Drivers**

Ensure you have the latest NVIDIA drivers installed for your GPU. You can download them from the [official NVIDIA website](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx).

**Step 2: Install PyTorch with CUDA Support**

After installing the NVIDIA drivers, you need to install a version of PyTorch that is compiled for your specific CUDA version.

1.  Go to the [PyTorch installation page](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).
2.  Use the interactive tool to generate the correct installation command for your system. Here is an example of the selections:
    *   **PyTorch Build:** Stable (e.g., 2.7.1)
    *   **Your OS:** Windows/Mac/Linux
    *   **Package:** Pip
    *   **Language:** Python
    *   **Compute Platform:** Select the CUDA version you want to use (e.g., CUDA 12.8).
3.  The website will generate a command for you to run. It will look similar to this:

```bash
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
```

**Important:** Run the exact command generated by the PyTorch website. This will replace the version of PyTorch you installed earlier with one that can communicate with your GPU.

**NOTE:** Latest PyTorch requires Python 3.9 or later.

### Script Setup

1.  **For the Transcription Suite**:
    - You can run the `whisper subtitles in turns...` script from anywhere on your computer. Just launch it, and it will connect with DaVinci Resolve.

2.  **For the Resolve-Integrated Tools**:
    - To make the `Interview Style Speech Timeline Generator.py` and `ResolveSubtitlePro.py` scripts appear inside DaVinci Resolve, copy them to the following directory:
      - **Windows**: `C:\ProgramData\Blackmagic Design\DaVinci Resolve\Fusion\Scripts\Utility\`
      - **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Blackmagic Design/DaVinci Resolve/Fusion/Scripts/Utility/`
      - **Linux**: `~/.local/share/BlackmagicDesign/DaVinci Resolve/Fusion/Scripts/Utility/`

    - After copying the files, restart DaVinci Resolve. You'll find the scripts under the `Workspace -> Scripts -> Utility` menu.

## Your Workflow: From Timeline to Final Subtitles
